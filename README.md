# About DevMoji
DevMoji was created by Christopher Conway. As a fresh bootcamp graduate, one of the most daunting goals was to contribute to opensource. In an effort to tackle this problem for other developers facing the same experience - he created DevMoji.

It provides a straight-forward way to contribute to opensource in a safe, risk-free environment that provides ample feedback and a way to actually see your contribution on the application. 

Please consider contributing to the project and seeing your own prompt/answer on the application! 

# Contributing

<img src="https://github.com/ConwayCJ/devmoji/assets/94498167/c989097a-acd9-4f46-984b-d2a696e1391d" align="right" width="250" alt="fork this repository"/>

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of the page.
This will create a copy of this repository on your account.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/ConwayCJ/devmoji/assets/94498167/1e12f33a-2177-4584-aaa5-5c78e4cc92b3" alt="clone this repository" />

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the `code` button and then click the `copy to clipboard` icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

`git clone url-you-just-copied`
where url-you-just-copied is replaced with the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there) of the project you cloned:

```javascript
cd devmoji
```

Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

```javascript
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

For example:

```javascript
git checkout -b new-prompt-conwaycj
```

## Add changes to Data.tsx file

   **Contribution requirements:**

   - Your contribution MUST match our <a href="/style_guidelines.md">style guidelines</a>. Please ensure there are not drastic formatting changes.

   - Please make prompts somewhat ambiguous. Obvious prompts may be requested to be changed.

   - Limit the amount of prompts you add to 2.

   Obvious example:
```javascript
{
  prompt: ["everyone", "loves", <CoffeeEmoji />],
  answer: "everyone loves coffee",
}
```

  Ambiguous version: 
```javascript
{
  prompt: [<GroupEmoji/>, <HeartEmoji/>, <CoffeeEmoji/>],
  answer: "everyone loves coffee",
}
```


  ### prompt key:
  - Must be an array. 3 items max. Use any number of emojis - either use emojis from your device or find one from any of the listed sites:
      [MaterialUI](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)\
      [React Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/)

  - ***Choosing a new emoji***\
   In Data.tsx - make sure you import your emoji like the example below. The FROM location must match the library you're using.\
    For example, React Icons [Font Awesome](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons?name=fa) has a different FROM location than [Hero Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons?name=hi)

```javascript
    //Font Awesome example:
    import { IconName } from "react-icons/fa";
```

  - If I want to use an icon from "Hero Icons", but that import doesn't exist in Data.tsx - I must import it from that new location. The Import syntax will be in the "Hero Icons" section at the [React Icons website](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons).

  ```javascript 
    //Font Awesome Icons:
    import { IconName } from "react-icons/fa";
    //Hero Icons:
    import { IconName } from "react-icons/hi";
  ```

  ### answer key:
  - Must be a string. Use lowercase lettering. See the "star trek" example below.
    
  - For example - your emojis are implying "star trek"

  - The "answer" key would be `'star trek'`



  ### socials key:
  - This is OPTIONAL. If you do not want links to your socials on the application, do not add a socials key.
  - The socials key is an object with two key:value pairs. GHurl and LIurl. Provide a link to your GitHub and LinkedIn as a string. 

  Completed example with socials:

```javascript
{
  prompt: [<Star/>, <RunningTrack/>],
  answer: "star trek",
  socials: {
    GHurl: 'https://github.com/ConwayCJ',
    LIurl: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/conwaycj',
  }
}
```

# Check your work

In the devmoji directory in your terminal, run `npm run dev`.

Play through the game or skip to the last prompt. If your contribution was successful it will appear on the last page before the confetti screen.

Put your answer in the input to check it was successful.
